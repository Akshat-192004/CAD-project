# Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Agriculture Recommendation System. The system aims to provide personalized recommendations to farmers to optimize their crop yields, resource usage, and overall farm management practices. By leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and domain knowledge, the system assists farmers in making informed decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.

# Data Fields
The agriculture recommendation system utilizes the following data fields for analysis and generating recommendations:

> N (Nitrogen): 
The ratio of Nitrogen content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.
 
> P (Phosphorous): 
The ratio of Phosphorous content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.

> K (Potassium): 
The ratio of Potassium content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.

> Temperature: 
The temperature at the farm location, measured in degrees Celsius.

> Humidity: 
The relative humidity at the farm location, expressed as a percentage.

> pH: 
The pH value of the soil, indicating its acidity or alkalinity.

> Rainfall: 
The amount of rainfall received at the farm location, measured in millimeters.


 These data fields serve as inputs for various algorithms and models within the recommendation system to generate personalized recommendations tailored to the specific soil and environmental conditions of the farm.
